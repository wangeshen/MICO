###How to use:
	1. Install IAR workbench for ARM v7.3 or higher
	2. Open any demo project and select target: EMW3162, MICO_EVB_1 (more demo boards are coming)
	3. Build and download MICO demo application
		Note: MICO demo runs on EMB-380-S2 + EMW3162/EMW3161: http://joinmx.com/tool.php?class_id=23&id=24
			Open1081: http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.32.BVcJ4C&id=38941373196&ns=1#detail
	4„ÄÅDownload and run Easylink APP from apple APP store, 
		https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/easylink/id820801172?mt=8
	5. Press "add" button on Easylink APP to add a new device
	6. Input ssid and password of the wlan that assoiated to iPhone, and start easylink
	7. Press easylink button on your module
	8. A new device appears on iPhone's screen, press this device, change and save these settings
	9. This new device appears on EasyLink app's main page, you can interact with it now!
	10. HomeKit demo cannot display on EasyLink app's main page, but it can play with any app based on HomeKit API on iOS8

###How to use apple HomeKit demo:
	1. Open and build demo project COM.Apple.HomeKit
    2. Follow steps above to connect device to local Wi-Fi network, If you connect an apple ipod authencation coprocessor to I2C port and define MICO_I2C_CP in platform.h, you can use apple wireless accessory configuration by uncommon #define CONFIG_MODE_WAC in MICODefine.h
    3. To setup the HomeKit accessories on your device you'll need a HomeKit app. Apple doesn't provide one and I don't know of any in the AppStore. I'm currently using this one: https://github.com/KhaosT/HomeKit-Demo
